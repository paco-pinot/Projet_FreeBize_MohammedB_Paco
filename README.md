# Projet_FreeBize_MohammedB_Paco

## Description

This project was completed as a duo after just one month of coursework. It marked one of our early projects, showcasing the skills we had acquired up to that point.
The project consists of a single page with anchor-based navigation, 
and we created our custom CSS classes to manage the styling, drawing inspiration from the approach of Tailwind CSS.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (with our custom CSS classes inspired by Tailwind CSS)

## Features

- Anchor-Based Navigation: The navbar includes links that direct users to different sections of the page.
- Custom CSS Classes: We crafted our custom CSS classes to handle the layout and styling of the site, drawing inspiration from Tailwind CSS.
